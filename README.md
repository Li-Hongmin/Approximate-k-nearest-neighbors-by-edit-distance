# Approximate k-nearest neighbors by edit distance 
 approximate k-nearest neighbors by edit distance 

I created this algorithm during my post doc at the University of Tokyo, Japan. I may publish a paper about it in the future.

This work is originally designed for the purpose of finding approximate k-nearest neighbors of amino acid sequences. However, it can be applied to any kind of sequences.
